**Repository for WiDS Datathon++ University Challenge 2025** - Predicting age from functional brain networks to analyze neurodevelopmental differences between sexes. Combines neuroimaging analysis with machine learning to advance understanding of mental health disorders.

## üåü Project Overview

**Challenge**: "How do brain networks develop differently across males and females in adolescence?"  
**Approach**:  
- Predict biological age from 2D functional connectivity matrices (fMRI)  
- Compare model performance between male/female subgroups  
- Analyze feature importance in age prediction  

**Social Impact**: Improve early detection of neuropsychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression, ADHD) through better understanding of sex-specific brain development patterns.
